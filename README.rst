This plugin allows your to start processes using the vastly under-appreciated spring-loaded_ Java agent, 
a FOSS alternative to JRebel (albiet a somewhat limited alternative).

Installation
============
sbt-spring-loaded requires SBT_ >= 0.13.5 (for AutoPlugin).  Add the following to your project/plugins.sbt::

  addSbtPlugin("me.browder" % "sbt-spring-loaded" % "0.1.0")

Usage
=====
Since this requires forking the jvm and we don't want to wait for the application to recompile there are special commands to run your code:  

:code:`reStart`
  start the mainClass of your project using spring-loaded, all arguments are passed though to it.

:code:`reStop`
  stop a previous invocation of mainClass

:code:`reList`
  list what projects that have reStart JVMs running
  
Typical use case::

  reStart
  ~compile

When you change your source you'll get new compiles which spring-loaded will pick up.
 
Special Thanks
==============
* SBT_
* `spray/sbt-revolver`_ for inspiration (the command lines are similar, hope you don't mind)
* spring-loaded_ - really really under apprecieted (at least by those outside of the Grails community)

TODO
====
* Determine if it's possible to parameterize the spring-loaded_ dependency. 
* Better logging
* Testing
